				<p>Hi, I'm Siddharth Shyniben!</p>
				<p>I am a programmer with a passion for crafting elegant solutions through well-written code.I thrive at the soft spot between building cool stuff and learning new things. My approach to coding combines creativity and technical skill to deliver unique and innovative solutions</p>
				<p>I love coding. Be it deep, complex architecture or beautiful websites, I can bring my skill to any project. Feel free to keep scrolling and check out my work!<p>

						On the frontend, I specialize in the three core
						languages: <span class="orange">HTML</span>,
						<span class="blue">CSS</span>, and
						<span class="yellow">JavaScript</span>.
						
						I am also proficient in <span class="red">Angular</span>
						and proficient with most popular frontend development
						frameworks like Express, Hugo, 11ty, etc.

						I am certified to be in the
						<a href="https://www.codingame.com/certification/FMBamJBEWhb2f4UOV8pGFQ">top
						1% of JavaScript professionals by CodinGame.</a>

						Check out my <a href="#frontend">Frontend projects</a>
						to see my skills in action!

						Backend is my favourite part of programming. I am a
						master of <span class='yellow'>JavaScript</span> and by
						extension TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and other related
						technologies.
						
						I am certified to be in the
						<a href="https://www.codingame.com/certification/FMBamJBEWhb2f4UOV8pGFQ">top
						1% of JavaScript professionals by CodinGame.</a>

						I have built complex architecture in JavaScript. I built
						a simple Raytracer and a few <a href="#">programming</a> <a
						href="#">languages</a> too. I also built
						<a href="https://github.com/SiddharthShyniben/nanoparse">some</a>
						of the
						<a href="https://github.com/SiddharthShyniben/planckcolors">smallest</a>
						libraries on npm. These are the kind of
						projects I LOVE working on.

						I am also learning <span class="green">Rust</span>. I
						rebuilt the (*sigh*, again?) Raytracer and programming
						language in rust too! I also know lua and bits of
						Python, Go and Python (kind of)

						And I don't really know if this counts, but I know
						VimScript.

						I am a command line person - All my coding uses solely
						the browser and the terminal. And so I'm a daily user
						of <span class="orange">git</span>, <span
						class="green">vim (neovim)</span> and the bash shell in
						general.

						If this is the very rare case of a fellow Vimmer reading
						this, check out my <a href="#">dotfiles!</a>

						I also use <span class="yellow">Hammerspoon</span> as a
						mini WM for my Mac.
